# CSCI212

An introduction to Assembly Language programming. Language syntax is covered,
together with a study of the instruction set mnemonics, segment, index, pointer,
general purpose and flag registers. A variety of memory addressing techniques
will be covered, as well as stack operations, particularly those associated with
passing parameters to subroutine calls. Also includes I/O to screen, printer, and
disk interfaces. Emphasis will be placed on interaction between the student’s code
and the operating system’s supplied functions for I/O to peripheral devices. Use
of editor and debugging tools will also be addressed.
